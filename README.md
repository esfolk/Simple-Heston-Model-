# Heston Model for Variance Process Simulation

In this repository, we explore the Heston Model, a stochastic volatility model, to simulate the variance process of stock prices. Through a Monte Carlo approach, we generate multiple possible trajectories for future variances.

## Introduction

The Heston Model is a two-dimensional stochastic process where one process represents the stock price and the other represents the variance or volatility. This model is often favored over the simpler Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model because of its ability to capture the volatility clustering observed in many financial time series.

## Model Formulation

## Model Formulation

The Heston Model is defined by two Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs):

```
dX_t = μ X_t dt + ζ_t X_t dW_{t1}
dζ_t = κ (θ - ζ_t) dt + σ_ζ √ζ_t dW_{t2}
```

Where:

- \( X_t \) is the stock price at time \( t \).
- \( ζ_t \) is the volatility process.
- \( W_{t1} \) and \( W_{t2} \) are Wiener processes with correlation \( ρ \).

## Parameter Estimation

In a real-world application, parameters like \( μ \), \( κ \), \( θ \), \( σ \), and \( ρ \) would ideally be estimated using:


1. **Option Pricing Data**: By calibrating the Heston model to market prices of options, one can derive the implied volatilities and, consequently, the model parameters.
2. **Sophisticated Estimation Methods**: Techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) can be employed to fit the model to historical data.

For our simulation, due to the absence of option pricing data, we made educated assumptions based on historical futures data and existing literature.

## Code Overview

The core of our implementation is the `HestonModel` class, which simulates the stock price and variance processes using the Euler-Maruyama method. We then use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate multiple paths for the variance process over a future period.

## Further Development

This model can be extended and built into something more sophisticated:

1. **Calibration**: Integrate with option pricing data to calibrate the model, adjusting parameters to fit observed market prices.
2. **Alternative Estimation Techniques**: Implement advanced estimation techniques such as MLE or Bayesian approaches to refine parameter estimates.
3. **Incorporate Other Factors**: Integrate macroeconomic indicators or other external factors to influence the drift and volatility parameters dynamically.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Back-test the model against historical data, evaluating its predictive power and adjusting accordingly.

## Conclusion

The Heston model, with its ability to capture stochastic volatility, offers a promising approach to simulate and predict financial market dynamics. By continuously refining and calibrating the model, one can achieve more accurate and actionable insights for trading and risk management.
